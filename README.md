# MathPebbles

MathPebbles is an interactive website spanning 400 web pages, covering
arithmetic, algebra, geometry, functions (single and multi, including calculus
of both kinds), probability/statistics, and professional mathematics. 

The goal is to have videos and a variety of interactive materials: texts, graphics,
programs, proofs, and practice materials. It also will have built-in
notetaking.

It is currently under development, but its current version can be found at
[the test site](https://test.mathpebbles.com)

## This repository

This repository is not quite everything you need to recreate this (the
external resourcres are not a part of yet nor is there a description), but it
contains the content and setup. 

It is created using my literate-programming environment. 

More words to come.
