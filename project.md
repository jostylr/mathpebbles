# Math Pebbles

This is the source for compiling the project. 

We first need to load the template: [templates](templates.md "load:")

Then we need to load the various books, chapters, sections. 

Then we can load a page and it loads all sub-pages. If we do the index page,
then they all get loaded!

[mp](pages/index.md "load:")

[poly](pages/algebra_polynomials.md "load")
