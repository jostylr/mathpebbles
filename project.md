# Math Pebbles

This is the source for compiling the project. 

We first need to load the template: [templates](templates.md "load:")

Then we need to load the various books, chapters, sections. 

Then we can load a page and it loads all sub-pages. If we do the index page,
then they all get loaded!

[mp](pages/index.md "load:")

[poly](pages/algebra_polynomials.md "load")

[one page](pages/algebra_constructing-the-real-and-complex-numbers_arithmetic-and-geometry-of-complex-numbers.md "load")


## Non-Mathy Stuff

We make the non-math pages here. It can be a simpler setup. The initial pages
are the About, FAQ, Support, Settings (not sure what we are settings, maybe morphs into
some account page), Table of Contents, and an Index.
