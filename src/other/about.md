## Main

    This is a site about learning how to use mathematics to explore the world
    around us. It ideally encompasses all of K-14 mathematics plus some. 

    It is authored by James Taylor, a mathematician and an educator. James has
    desired making an exploratory site like this for over 30 years, but this
    is the first main attempt.

    It is organized into seven books, each with seven chapters, and each of
    those chapters has seven sections. The number of subsections is variable,
    but seven is a cool target. 

    Seven is the number of points and the number of lines in the Fano plane,
    the symbol at the bottom of the main page. It is a lovely figure. 

    It is expected that the site will take seven years from the time of this
    writing. So a final date of 2028. The first three books should hopefully
    be done withing a year, so by mid-2022. 

    ## Exploratory Tools

    The idea behind this site was to create a place for really exploring the
    mathematical ideas. Many tools allow one to explore a problem, but not so
    much a technique. Often times, tools will provide the answers, but with
    very little understanding of how to achieve those results.
