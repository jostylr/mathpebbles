    [Lost Math Lessons](https://lostmathlessons.blogspot.com/) Someone who
    comes across interesting math topics that are not taught anymore. For
    example, they had a post on the higher version of [synthetic
    division](https://lostmathlessons.blogspot.com/2016/02/synthetic-division-with-higher-powers.html)

    ## Websites

    [Steam Coded(https://steamcoded.org/math.html) A collection of free
    resources in a retro website. Has a variety of SVG resources. 


    ## Helpful Stuff in Creating This Website

    Not related to math, but these are resources that I found helpful in
    making the website. Note that I have been dabbling in web stuff for many
    years though it is only a hobby and my proficiency is intermediate (better
    at the coding, worse at the design! )

    * [Shoelaces](https://shoelace.style/). This is a useful little web
      component library for doing the UI elements nicely (buttons,
      dropdowns, details, drawers).  
    * [Remixicons](https://remixicon.com/) Free SVG icons. Some of their icons
      made their way into the Fano plane.
