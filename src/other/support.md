## Main

    <p>This is a page with support options for both the website and its users.
    The intention is that in the future, one can sign
    up for a patreon support or something else perhaps. In exchange, there may
    be some support options, such as a Discord server. There should also be an
    issue submission thing. </p>


    <p> This could also offer a tutorial of various conventions and ideas in
    the site. Ideally this is not necessary, but it could. </p>

## Styling
