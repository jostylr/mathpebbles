## Intro

    With an understanding of distance, we can now define lines and circles.
    Once we define them, we can define angles and triangles. After that, we
    get all sorts of interesting figures to ponder.

## Ideas

[pebble]()

    Explore all these objects and the measurements involved

[proof]()

    prove various statements here, particularly pythagorean theorem, areas. 

[program]()

    Compute these various quantities


## Lines

    Every portion of a line is a straight path (line segment). Straight line
    kind of redundant but not entirely. That is any two points on a line have the
    property that the shortest path between them lies on the line.

## Circles

    All points a fixed distance from a given center point. This can be done by
    taking a line segment and sweeping it out with one point fixed. 

    Circumference, area

## Angles

    Angles represent two lines meeting. To be specific, pick the two halves of
    the lines (rays) which will represent the sides of the angle. The
    intersection point is called vertex. 

    Given two points on a circle, measure distance along the circle. Divide by
    circumference. This gives a decimal representation of the measure of the
    angle. It is truly unitless. 

    One can get customary measures by multiplying by whatever a full rotation
    should measure to be; 360 for degrees, 2pi for radians

## Triangles


    Three points, three line segments joining them. Defines a triangle. 

    Angles add up to a straight angle. 

    right triangles

    Pythagorean Theorem

    Area?

## Polygons


    A quick intro to polygons? Followed by dividing up a circle with n points
    and computing the circumference/area? maybe in proofs? ???
