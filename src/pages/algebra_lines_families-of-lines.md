## Intro

    Here we look at some questions of categorizing lines based on some
    relational criteria.

## Teaser

    Lines that never meet? Lines that make corners?

## Ideas

[pebble]()

    Explore the properties of the lines, interseciton solutions, angles. 

[proof]()

    Full proof of these families of lines having the common properties. 

[program]()

    Implement choosing a member of a family with functions. 


## Parallel Lines




##### Pebble


##### Code


## Perpendicular Lines




##### Pebble


##### Code


## Co Intersecting Lines

    common form being (y-b) = m (x-a) where m varies


##### Pebble


##### Code


## Co Angle Lines

    ultimately same as parallel, but deduce that. Concrete way to determine
    parallelity. See if we can get distance to intersection of nearly
    co-angle.
