## Estimating Power of 10


    5234 raised to 7th power, 5E3 to 7, 5 to 7 E21 5 cubed is about 100 so
    maybe E5  so E26.

## Powers of 2

    maybe using powers of 2 such as 5^7 = 10^7/ 2^7 and 2^7 is 128 so about
    100 so 10^5 is an overestimate and 10^4 is underestimate but closer to
    10^5.

## Units


    Units are denoted with powers. 

    Comparing feet to inches at different powers

## Number Sense as Superpower

    The ability to estimate the right power of 10 gives a great sense of
    appropriate numbers in a context
