## Intro

    In [Arithmetic](arithmetic.html), we learned all about numbers and the
    basic ways of combining them (adding, multiplying, subtracting, division,
    and powering). 

    In Algebra, we start to learn how to think of objects that take in various
    numbers into the same formula and what we can do with that. 

    The focus here is largely formulas involving addition, multiplying, and
    powering. Subtraction is subsumed by multiplying by negative numbers and
    does not play a special role. Division by unknown variables is not fully
    taken up until the [Functions](functions.md) book, but we do see some
    shadows of it in the polynomial chapter. 

    By the end of this book, you should be comfortable with quite a bit of
    useful, practical mathematics and well posed to solve: 

    !-

    Here are some highlights of what we will learn how to do:

    Model a problem with a linear equation

    Solve a linear equation 

    Model situations with quadratics

    Solve a quadratic equation

    Find the maximum or minimun of a quadratic

    Solve polynomial equations

    Recenter polynomials (gateway to calculus)

    Graph polynomials
    
    Solve inequalities

    Solve absolute value equations

    Find out how much one will owe
    
    Amortization

    Solving systems of linear equations

    Exploring real and complex numbers

    How do we describe the world? How do we figure out how much to save to get
    to a target savings when we have interest applied to it? How does interest
    actually work? If I throw this ball up, how high will it go, where does it
    go? 

    We will explore lines (fundamental to everything), quadratics (hills and
    bowls), polynomials (express all sorts of shapes), inequalities and
    absolute values (exploring notions of being far apart), interest and other
    topics of personal finance, and systems of lines that dip our toes into
    strong applications of stuff. Our final chapter deals with defining real
    and complex numbers, completing the construction of our basic number system.
