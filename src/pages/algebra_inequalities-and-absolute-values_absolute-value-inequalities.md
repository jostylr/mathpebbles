## Intro

    Inequalities help us impose limits in a world in which perfect precision
    is not possible.

    For example, let's say that we want to get as many donuts as
    possible while not going over $10. Let's say each donut costs $.79. Then
    we want to find an positive integer {$$}n{/$$}such that {$$}n*0.79 < 10{/$$}.
    Solving the for {$$}n{/$$}. We will go over such problems and expand on
    them in some depth in the first two sections. 

    We explore a classic inequality called the triangle inequality. It is the
    algebraic expression of the basic idea that going along the other two
    sides of a triangle takes longer than going along the third side. 

    We spend a few sections on absolute values. Absolute values seem fairly
    harmless at first as it seems we are just erasing negative signs. But it
    quickly gets difficult with variables involved. 

    We end with extending the idea of absolute value to that of a more general
    notion of distance.

## Teaser

    Inequalities and absolute values are notorious for being confusing.
    Building on our notion of distance, we hopefully will convey some
    interesting ideas about it. We will explore some stuff using polynomials,
    but the majority of an introduction to this material is with lines. 

    With our core example set in place, we then move on into exploring
    inequalities fully, including the extremely useful but confusing topic of
    abslute values.
