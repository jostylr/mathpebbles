## Intro

    If we are on a budget, we care about spending less than the budgeted
    amount, not spending exactly the budgeted amount. Inequalities are how we
    describe that situation. With a few modifications, we can approach them
    the same way we did solving lines.

## Teaser

    Inequalities are notoriously difficult. But we can tackle them almost the
    same way as we tackle solving a line. We just have to be mindful of
    direction.
