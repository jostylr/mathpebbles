## Intro

##### Pebble

## Teaser

    How do we make sense of a number whose decimal portion goes on forever in
    new and exciting ways? How can we make sense of imaginary numbers?

    Here we investigate in what sense we can say the real and complex numbers
    are real. How do we define them such that it is clear that they exist?
    What are their properties? In addition to exploring real numbers, we also
    delve a little deeper into the relationship of multiplication and
    rotations in the realm of complex numbers. We conclude this chapter with
    an investigation into what sense are there different sizes of infinity.
