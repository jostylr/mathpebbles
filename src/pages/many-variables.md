## Intro

    Much of mathematical education deals with a single variable setup. This is
    partly because that is a necessary foundation to understand before moving
    onto many variables. But it is also in part because we can say a lot more
    about single variable systems in a way that is understandable and crisp. 

    As with single variable analysis, the linear case forms a solid foundation
    for much of our later analysis. Most systems are non-linear, but for small
    purposes, we can approximate them with something linear. It often gives us
    qualitative pictures even when quantitative predictions are not possible.
    
    We therefore start with linear algebra, a subject that can is both
    abstractly beautiful as well as powerful in practice. A major focus of the
    abstraction is the fluidity in how we represent our objects with numbers.
 
    We use our new skills in with linear systems of equations to explore
    systems of ordinary differential equations, starting with the captivating
    predator-prey system. As we proceed through the chapter, we will delve
    into the non-linear systems and how that turns into chaos. 

    With a firm grasp of the linear, we then turn our attention to functions
    of many variables and functions that give many outputs for a given input.
    We first explore the nature of those functions, illuminating the
    complexities of even polynomials of many variables. We then launch into
    the realms of differentiating and integrating such functions. There are
    different generalizations of our one variable experience that we will
    explore including generalizing the very practically important 
    Newton's method to this context.  
    
    After having learned what a partial differential is, we then proceed to
    look at equations involving partial derivatives. These are equations that
    appear quite a bit in a variety of fields, notably physics and
    engineering. The basic idea is that we know a function that relates the
    partial derivatives of a function and we have some initial conditions (if
    we want to evolve the function trhough time) or some boundary conditions
    (if we want to have a function defined over a region). These are highly
    non-trivial problems to work on and we will explore some of the
    techniques. 

    We conclude this book with a look at curved spaces. For example, what are
    the straight lines on our planet? How do we use the flat stuff we just did
    and apply to these curvy stuff? The idea of tangent spaces, reminiscent of
    tangent lines, will play a crucial role here. We also explore the ideas of
    having a distance function on a space which will tell us what a straight
    line it (minimizes distance). 

    ## Further Readings

    For linear algebra and multivariable calculus, I highly recommend the book
    ["Vector Calculus, Linear Algebra, and Differential Forms"](http://matrixeditions.com/5thUnifiedApproach.html) by John Hubbard
    and Barbara Hubbard. It goes into beautiful and full detail into all of
    the topics here. To truly master this subject, get this book.  
    
    For a life-based view of some differential equations systems, including
    preadtor-prey setups, I recommend "A Primer of Ecology" by Nicholas
    Gotelli.

## Teaser

    There are many inputs that go into producing an output and, in truth, the
    output usually consists of many things. To model this, we need to
    understand the world of functions that take in many (or one) and produce
    one (or many) items. 

    How do our single variable tools translate? What new problems arise and
    what new opportunities? 

    This is difficult material. We start with a codification of linearity in a
    many-to-many world. We apply those systems to systems of differential
    equations, a bedrock for predicting the future. We then dive into how
    calculus evolves in this new world. We finish with the advanced topics of
    partial differential equations and notions of curved spaces (manifolds).
