## Intro

The idea of number as mapping

symbols for the number of something

extra digits as piles

pictures, colored pebbles, colored piles

units as piles, different digit systems, using `:` as separator of
different bins of counting, eventually replacing the separator with a way
of counting

    This chapter may be tempting to skip as surely you know how to count if
    you are reading this. But having a firm grasp on what a number is will
    help greatly in demystifying mathematics from being gospel into being common
    sense. 

    !-

    The basic idea of counting is a very old and foundational idea for humans.
    It started with simple matching of the objects of interest with tracking
    markers such as pebbles to be kept in a bag. From these humble origins,
    more and more extensive and permanent means of tracking emerged, along
    with predictive means. 

    We will not be learning how to count here. Most people naturally pick it
    up from those around them. But we will look at and analyze the emergence
    of the natural numbers from that perspective. 

    We start with the concept of number as correspnding to groups of objects.
    This leads to not only a notion of equality, but also what it means for
    there to be more in one group than another. 

    From this, arises the ideas of using symbols for each number. Eventually,
    we run out of our ability to know the symbols representing all of this and
    we need a system of compacting the numbers. This gives rise to using
    combinations of the symbols (digits) to represent larger numbers.

    We then delve into tagging numbers with what they are representing. It
    turns out that this is an extremely important notion that mathematics
    often neglects, much to the detriment of the intuition of the mathematical
    learning. 

    What happens if we have a different number of base symbols? Conceptually,
    this is simple. In practice, it is head spinning. So we will just gingerly
    step down that road a little. 

    We conclude this chapter with the unanswerable question "Is there a
    largest number?" We explore some reasonable answers that one might have to
    this question.
