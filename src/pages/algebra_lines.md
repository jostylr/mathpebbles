## Intro
  
    Lines are where we begin. We take the notion of a straight line as being
    the objects that, given two destinations on the line (points), the
    shortest path between those those two points lies entirely on the line.
    This is the human centered approach because we innately have a sense of
    distance. We know from walking along paths which path is shorter. Using
    distance as our guide, we use that to define lines, triangle, circles, and
    angles. Once we have those, we can construct a coordinate system. This
    system gives us a means of plotting and visualizing the objects we will be
    talking about. With the right tools in place, we can then define slopes of
    straight lines, something which is often assumed in the standard treatment
    of textbooks. We will take some time to learn how to solve linear
    equations, a crucial topic to be comfortable with. We will look at various
    techniques to do so. We apply those techniques to the particular cases of
    perpendicular and parallel lines. We conclude with revisiting the solution
    techniques in the situation of linear inequalities which we solve in
    similar fashions with a few twists.

    Straight lines give us the shortest path between two points. That
    fundamental insight will allow us to explore deeply not only lines, but
    all sorts of other geometric notions that come with lines. We will also
    explore setting up and solving both linear equations linear inequalities.
