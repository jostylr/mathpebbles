## Intro

    ### Negative Numbers as Debt
    
    Debt is put down in terms of a positive number but it has a negative
    connotation. 

    ### Total Wealth

    The idea of an integer as representing total wealth, factoring in cash and
    debt.  (cash is stand-in for assets because the word assets is a little
    bit foreign for many) 

    Reduction to one of them being zero and taking that for the symbol, using
    a negative sign if it is the debt that is positive. 
    
    Zero as cash equals debt.

    Note different pairs that are equivalent represent different actual
    situations, but we ignore those equivalences. 

    ### Addition of Integers

    ### Subtraction of Integers

    Flip and add. 

    ### Multiplication of Integers

    what it represents: one is amount of cash/debt; the other is representing
    repeated adding that amount or removing the amount. Removal of debt is
    adding cash. 
    
    ### Glimpse of Properties

    commutative, distributive

    ### Lines

    For those familiar with lines (first chapter of next book), integers can
    be represented as lines with slope 1 with the integer being the place
    where the line crosses the x-axis. So y = x - i  where i is the integer. 

    Representation of arithmetic on line. Reference line is y = x; use
    horizontal line segments from y=x to point in question, then do the
    operations. 



[pebble]()

    Exploring a debt, cash pair, showing equivalence to a 0-partner and hence
    to a symbol for the integer. 

[proof]()

    Proof the equivalences of the operations. establish the most interest
    properties (commutative of multiplication, distributive).
