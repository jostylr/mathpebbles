## Intro

    ### Counts of Divided Regions
    
    The denominator says how many divisions per region, numerator is the
    count. 

    Note inherently positive point of view.

    ### Equivalent Divisions 

    Doubling both leads to a physically distinct situation, but same area

    ### Addition with Same Denominator

    Adding the counts

    ### Natural Multiplication 

    Adding repeatedly -- leads to multiplying numerator

    ### Natural Division

    Dividing a rational by a natural number is dividing each divided region into
    more of its pieces. The numerator still just counts the total number of
    pieces. So the number gets smaller. 

    ### Multiplication by a Fraction

    Putting those two things together, we multiply top and bottom. 

    ### Division by a Fraction

    Focus on dividing 1 region. Once that's done, we just multiply. 

    Scale the original 1 region to match the size of the denominator. Then
    count the regions that the 1 region occupies. So dividing by 1/2 leads to
    half the original region so there is a two count there. Dividing by 3/2
    leads to a full region plus 1/2. So the original occupies 2/3 of that. 

    It comes out to multiplying by the reciprocal. Try to really sell this
    notion. 

    ### Addition

    Common denominators

    ### Subtraction

    above was all positive rationals. Now we can employ the same trick as
    before. 

    ### Equivalence of Operations
    
    show that doing all these things does not depend on the representatives.
    do a numerical example here; proof does it in general. 

    ### Rational Lines
    
    Each line through the origin represents a rational number. If it has slope
    m, then 1/m is the corresponding rational number (basically change in y
    over change in x and we represent the pairs as (numerator, denominator). 

    Addition represented by fixing the y-coordinate and then adding the
    horizontal line segment of the smaller past the larger one. Subtraction is
    the line segment in between, shifted to y-axis.  Multiplication is
    projection to of coordinates and doing the multiplication there (what is
    multiplying line segment lengths)? then plotting the point and getting the
    line. 


[pebble]()

    picture representations of fractions, getting to be the same denominator

[proof]()

    go through the rational operations. prove the subtraction and division are
    inverses of addition and multiplication

[program]()

    implement rational arithmetic
