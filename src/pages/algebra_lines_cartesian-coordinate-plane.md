## Intro

    Now that we have a notion of distance, straight lines, and right angles,
    we can finally create a coordinate plane. This will allow us to say how
    far we are from the agreed upon center in terms of horizontal and vertical
    distance; we need to choose an orientation for what positive and negative
    mean as well.

## Ideas


[pebble]()

    Construct the grid and axes

    distances between points

    change grids without changing units but same distance

    change grids with changing units, then different distance. 

[proof]()

    prove distance is the same for grids using the same units even if rotated.
    Not sure if we can do that with just these tools. 

[program]()

    Plotting points, measuring distances.
