## Intro

## Teaser

    The natural successor of lines are quadratics. We go from `x`$ to `x^2`$.
    While the quadratic formula is a way of solving quadratic equations, of
    more interest with quadratics is finding the high (or low) point of the
    quadratic. This is what quadratics model for us. We also end up exploring
    something called imaginary numbers. 

    !- 

    With lines firmly understood, the next set of objects to learn about is
    when we square the unknown variable. We call these quadratics. They are
    shaped somewhat like a rounded bowl, either upside down (concave down) or
    rightside up (concave up). A key feature to compute, and easy to do, is
    the vertex, which is either the highest or lowest point of the quadratic,
    depending on whether it is concave down or up, respectively. Once we can
    the vertex, we can then look into solving quadratics. We inevitably end up
    computing square roots including the seemingly impossible task of
    computing square roots of negative numbers leading us to imaginary
    numbers. We conclude with examing a variety of common quadratic problems
    for solving both quadratic equations and inequalities.
