## Intro

    the initial bag of units being the symbols 0 through 9. 

    picture of dots for each digit, grouping those in smaller amounts when
    possible (6 as two three dots, but seven as just one row).

    * P: [Subconscious Counting](https://mathpebbles.com/subconscious-counting.html) 
      A good exercise is to look at groups of obejcts and just say the number of
      objects there is. Do not count; simply state the number. Then check.
      Repeat. As you do this, you should find that five objects is reasonably
      easy to spot while ten objects is difficult if not well-grouped. 

[proof]()

    some formal definition of the digits? 

[program]()

    generating the picture of dots? (more fun than math)
    
    or creating a notion of number for each of these symbols, a canonical set
    of objects?
