## Intro

##### Pebble

## Teaser

    One of the most useful tools in all of mathematics is that of linear
    systems. These have the complexity to be useful but the simplicity to be
    solvable.

    !-

    What if we had a number of variables and linear relations between them?
    This is the foundation for handling the messiness of real-life with lots
    of different information. While we delve into it fully in another book
    later in the series, here we present some commonly useful and applicable
    approaches. We conclude the chapter with systems involving linear
    inequalities, a topic called linear programming. It has a rather fun
    algorithmic solution method called the simplex method.
