## Intro


    Arithmetic is the heart of useful mathematics. Most people learn the many
    basic notions and computations of arithmetic on their own. As it gets more
    complex, there are techniques that one can learn to make it quite easy.
    Unfortunately, such techniques are rarely taught and tedious, backward
    techniques are taught instead. 

    We will start with counting, followed by addition, multiplication,
    subtraction, division, and powers. Those chapters will focus on simply doing the
    computational aspects with an eye to understanding what is going on
    relative to some intuitive pictures. We conclude this part with an abstract
    walk into constructing the natural numbers, integers, and rational numbers.
    Ideally these constructions will give some of these numbers a more
    accessible feel, but it is safe to skip over the constructions. 
    
    One of the main reasons for readers to read this book is that the
    methodology of computing the operations, going from left to right,
    naturally leads to a more intuitive appreciation for estimating the size
    of numbers. When we are taught to look at the left to start our
    computations, we naturally start looking left. And that is where the most
    essential information lies.

    You may already know how to count, add, multiply, subtract, divide,
    and exponentiate. Should you peruse this material? 

    Yes, yes you should. The techniques in here are both faster and more
    enlightening than traditional techniques (for the most part). We also
    provide a solid foundation for understanding these operations
    mathematically. At least skim it!

    Throughout, we highlight issues of units and signifcant digits as well.
    These ideas are often poorly understood due to a lack of exploration. This
    site enables such exploration quite readily. 

    In the powers chapter, we also discuss guesstimation which is a
    fundamental tool in applying numbers to understanding reality. If you are
    not well-versed in guesstimation, be sure to read that. 

    The final chapter, that on constructing numbers, gives a solid foundation
    for all the numbers we require for these operations, including integral
    powers. For what happens with fractional powers, we leave to the last
    chapter of Algbera. Why learn the constructions? Personally, I find it
    satisfying to have a notion of how all of our numbers can come from,
    literally, nothing, as long as nothing is considered a something. While
    not particularly of practical importance, the goal of this site is not
    just provide a useful approach to mathematics, but also a satisfying approach.
