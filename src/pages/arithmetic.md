## Intro


    Arithmetic is the heart of useful mathematics. Most people learn the many
    basic notions and computations of arithmetic on their own. As it gets more
    complex, there are techniques that one can learn to make it quite easy.
    Unfortunately, such techniques are rarely taught and tedious, backward
    techniques are taught instead. 

    We will start with counting, followed by addition, multiplication,
    subtraction, division, and powers. Those chapters will focus on simply doing the
    computational aspects with an eye to understanding what is going on
    relative to some intuitive pictures. We conclude this part with an abstract
    walk into constructing the natural numbers, integers, and rational numbers.
    Ideally these constructions will give some of these numbers a more
    accessible feel, but it is safe to skip over the constructions. 
    
    One of the main reasons for readers to read this book is that the
    methodology of computing the operations, going from left to right,
    naturally leads to a more intuitive appreciation for estimating the size
    of numbers. When we are taught to look at the left to start our
    computations, we naturally start looking left. And that is where the most
    essential information lies.
