## Intro


    Functions form a fundamental foundation of mathematics, second only in
    importance to numbers themselves. These are the objects that we model and
    explore the world with. We have already explored several important
    families of functions: lines, quadratics, and more general polynomials. In
    that investigation, we stumbled onto the ideas of calculus. Here we find
    the foundations to extend calculus to more general functions and then use
    calculus to define the functions. 

    This approach is a little unorthodox in that some of the most common
    functions to play around with in the calculus introductions will actually
    be developed afterwards. This is not only a logical correction, but I
    think it helps slow down the steps so that calculus never feels like some
    kind of magic trick, but rather will become a faithful and well-understood
    tool. 

    We start with finishing off what we can do with the arithmetic operations
    and unknown functions. We explore the algebraic functions, though largely
    confine our explorations to the explicit types of ratios of polynommials
    and adding in radical functions. We explore how to do calculus with these
    functions from a more approximative viewpoint. 

    Full calculus inevitably deals with notions of infinity and so we explore
    various notions of infinity, starting with stuff just involving infinite
    strings of numbers. 

    We then move on to some infinite notions involving functions which largely
    goes under the broad foundational notion of limit. The idea of a limit is
    to look at behavior near the point of interest, but not at it. It is
    similar to asking a person's neighbors about the person to gather
    information. Such a tactic does not give you the full information after
    one asking, but after many asks, a pattern develops and a notion arises.
    Unlike asking neighbors, computing limits is not considered rude. 

    With limits undestood, we can then tackle the abstract version of
    differential calculus and integral calculus. Differential calculus is
    about gathering slopes and deducing geometric information. Integral
    calculus is about undoing derivatives as well as computing areas, lengths,
    volumes, etc. Derivatives give us ways of simplifying problems, including
    the very important Newton'smethod, while integrals give us a way of
    assessing the accumulation of errors. 

    With the tools of calculus firmly set in place, we can finally proceed
    into some notable transcendental functions. Exponentials arise from
    notions of population growth, whether it be actual life forms, compound
    interest, or radioactive decay. To deal with the extreme scales of
    exponentials, logarithms are useful to have around. They can be derived in
    a variety of fashions, which we will do, but a somewhat explicit method
    comes from computing the needed nominal annual interest rate to achieve a
    desired effective annual rate. 

    The other major function family is that of the trigonometric functions.
    While they start off as functions related to right triangles and various
    geometric computations, they rapidly become far more important as the
    foundations for periodic functions. If you have repeating behavior, reach
    for some trigonometric functions. We conclude the trigonometric chapter
    with a view towards the complex exponential, a convenient idea that merges
    the ideas and rules of exponentials with that of trigonometric functions. 

    Our final chapter is an exploration of defining and transforming
    functions. We start with "polynomials with infinitely many terms",
    generally known as a power series; convergent ones lead to a Taylor
    series which can represent a function entirely if everything is nice
    enough.  We then explore functions coming from equations, partiuclarly
    differential equations. This then leads to whole new families of
    functions, of which we take a quick look at. Differential equations also
    lead to some special transformations, such as the Laplace transform which
    transforms differential equatons into algebraic equations.

## Teaser

    Functions are as fundamental to mathematics as numbers are. They give us
    the power to describe inputs and outputs. We have already seen functions
    in our exploration of lines, quadratics, and general polynomials. 

    We start with a couple of problematic function types that arise from
    arithmetic: rational and radical functions. After getting some familiarity
    with the calculus in this situation, we delve into more generality the
    notions of infinity, differential, and integral calculus. 

    With the general calculus stage set, we then explore the first
    transcendental functions: exponentials, logarithms, and trigonometric
    functions. These are the foundations for modeling many interesting
    behaviors. 

    We finish with how we can define functions in general using various kinds
    of equations and transformations to accomplish our goals. We also include
    a section on special functions, which are useful in many areas but are a
    bit on the technical side.
