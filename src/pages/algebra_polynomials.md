## Intro

## Teaser

    While lines and quadratics form the basis for the most important aspects
    of some local notions, polynomials are the wide family that can model just
    about anything over a given limited space. The full notion of that is what
    calculus does, but we will explore a lot of those techniques using a tool
    called synthetic division.

    !- 

    What about higher powers of the unknown? We can do that. Those are called
    polynomials, which includes lines and quadratics. After introducing them,
    we will learn a crucial technique called synthetic division. Our approach
    uses that technique in ways rarely seen elsewhere. We will find that not
    only is synthetic division useful for factoring polynomials (the typical
    use), but can also be used for essentially doing calculus with polynomials
    without the magic and craziness of standard calculus. This gives us
    tremendous insight, both algebraically and visually, early on into fully
    mastering polynomials with nothing but the basic notions of arithmetic.
    We conclude with taking powers of polynomials, in particular patterns of
    expansions.
